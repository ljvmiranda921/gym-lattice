    [dill1989lattice]_.

    It follows an absolute Cartesian coordinate system, the location of
    the polymer is stated independently from one another. Thus, we have
    four actions (left, right, up, and down) and a chance of collision.

    The environment will first place the initial polymer at the origin. Then,
    for each step, agents place another polymer to the lattice. An episode
    ends when all polymers are placed, i.e. when the length of the action
    chain is equal to the length of the input sequence minus 1. We then
    compute the reward using the energy minimization rule while accounting
    for the collisions and traps.

    Attributes
    ----------
    seq : str
        Polymer sequence describing a particular protein.
    state : OrderedDict
        Dictionary of the current polymer chain with coordinates and

    actions : list
        List of actions performed by the model.
    collisions : int
        Number of collisions incurred by the model.
